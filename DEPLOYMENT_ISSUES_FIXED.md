# Deployment Issues Found and Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Missing Server Package.json**
**Problem**: The server folder didn't have its own `package.json`, which would cause Render deployment to fail.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Created `server/package.json` with proper dependencies and scripts
- ✅ Configured for Node.js 18.x and production deployment
- ✅ Removed frontend-related dependencies

### 2. ❌ **Frontend API Configuration Issue**
**Problem**: The frontend was using relative URLs (like `/users/login`) which work in development with the proxy but fail in production.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/config/api.js` for environment-based API URLs
- ✅ Created `frontend/src/config/axios.js` with axios instance and interceptors
- ✅ Updated all action files (`userActions.jsx`, `studentActions.jsx`, `attendanceActions.jsx`)
- ✅ Implemented automatic token handling and error management
- ✅ Removed manual token handling (now handled by interceptors)

### 3. ❌ **CORS Configuration**
**Problem**: Backend didn't have CORS configured for cross-origin requests from frontend.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added `cors` dependency to server package.json
- ✅ Configured CORS in `server/index.js` with environment-based origin
- ✅ Added `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable support

### 4. ❌ **Environment Variables**
**Problem**: Missing environment variable templates and documentation.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `server/env.example` with all required variables
- ✅ Created `frontend/env.production.example` for production configuration
- ✅ Updated deployment guide with complete environment variable setup

### 5. ❌ **Vercel Configuration**
**Problem**: Missing Vercel deployment configuration.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Created `frontend/vercel.json` for proper Vercel deployment
- ✅ Configured build settings and routing
- ✅ Set up environment variable handling
